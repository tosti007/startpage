# startpage
My personal startpage, feel free to take some inspiration from it. Good luck and have fun!

# References
## FontAwesome/icons
I got the icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Opted to go for downloading raw svg files to support for offline compatibility.

## Vecta.io/symbols
Some more icons that FontAwesome didn't have I downloaded from [vecta.io](https://vecta.io/symbols).

##  grtcdr/startpages 
I used [grtcdr/startpages](https://github.com/grtcdr/startpages) as a base template and copy-pasted things from there, so much credits to him. 

## Goodkatz/Simple CSS Waves
For the waves I used a codepen created by Goodkatz, which can be found at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/goodkatz/pen/LYPGxQz).

## Barrett Sonntag/CSS filter generator
In order to color external svg icons I used the [CSS filter generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) on CodePen. Note I used this in previous versions, as I now moved all SVG definitions inside the HTML.

## Peter Collingridge/SVG optimiser
I used [Peter's tool](https://petercollingridge.appspot.com/svg-optimiser) in order to minimize the sizes of any svg files I used.

## svg/svgo
Additonally to Peter's SVG optimiser I also used [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) some some icons as it tends to apply some additional cleaning.
