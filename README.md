## FontAwesome/icons
I got the icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Opted to go for downloading raw svg files to support for offline compatibility.

##  grtcdr/startpages 
I used [grtcdr/startpages](https://github.com/grtcdr/startpages) as a base template and copy-pasted things from there, so much credits to him. 

## Goodkatz/Simple CSS Waves
For the waves I used a codepen created by Goodkatz, which can be found at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/goodkatz/pen/LYPGxQz).

## Barrett Sonntag/CSS filter generator
In order to color external svg icons I used the [CSS filter generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) on CodePen.

## Peter Collingridge/SVG optimiser
I used [Peter's tool](https://petercollingridge.appspot.com/svg-optimiser) in order to minimize the sizes of any svg files I used.
